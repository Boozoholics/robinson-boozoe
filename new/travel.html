There are several ways of going to the party.
<p>
<strong>By car from Oslo</strong><br>
Leave Oslo using <strong>E18 towards Drammen</strong>. Leave the highway at <strong>Holmen</strong> (not too far after IKEA), and drive <strong>RV165</strong> past Hvervinbukta and Leangbukta towards Vettre. When you get to there <strong>turn left by the shop</strong>, down Konlungveien. Follow that road until you reach a big parking lot (Spirabukta), this is where you park. This is the right time to <strong>call us</strong> (menace, kusma or leia) to order boat-pickup. The next thing to do is to walk along the road for a couple of minutes until you reach a brigde, this is were you'll get picked up by boat.<br>
We will of course also put up some signs.

<p>
<strong>By car from West</strong><br>
Get to E18 and drive as if you were going to Oslo. Then when you reach Asker you should start looking for the sign to "Holmen". When you see it, follow the directions above. If you pass Ikea, you've gone too far.

<p>
<strong>By bus from Oslo</strong><br>
There is about an hour of bus riding from Oslo to the party place. You take bus number TBA.

<strong>By bus from Oslo</strong><br>

All of these should get you all the way to the party location.
