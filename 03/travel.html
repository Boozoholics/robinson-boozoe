There are several ways of going to the party.
<p>
<strong>By car from Oslo</strong><br>
The entire cartrip takes about 25 minutes with little or no traffic. You start of by leaving Oslo using <strong>E18 towards Drammen</strong>. Leave the highway at <strong>Holmenkrysset</strong>, the first right going road after IKEA, and drive <strong>RV165</strong> following signs to Slemmestad and Drøbak. 4.3 kilometers after you leave E18, you take a left turn (right after a gas-station at the right side), and follow signs towards Konglungen and Spirabukta. This is the right time to <strong>call us</strong> (menace, kusma or leia) to order boat-pickup. Drive for another 1.4 kilometers and you get to a parking lot at the right side. This is where you park your car, and from there the walk is really short. Ulike previous announcements, you do NOT follow the road to Konglungen, but rather follow the small road (or rather a large path) located in one of the corners of the parking lot down to the water. The meetingpoint will be the dock by a red boat-house.<br>
We will of course also put up some signs. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>By car from West</strong><br>
Get to E18 and drive as if you were going to Oslo. Then when you reach Asker you should start looking for the sign to "Holmen". When you see it, follow the directions above. If you pass Ikea, you've gone too far.

<p>
<strong>By bus from Oslo</strong><br>
There is about an hour of bus riding from Oslo to the party place. You take bus number 251 or 252 to Vettre and walk down Konglungveien untill you reach the right-side parking lot.
</p>

<p>
<strong>By bus from Asker</strong><br>
Quite straight forward. Just take bus number 707 or 713 to Vettre and walk as if you took the bus from Oslo
</p>

All of these should get you all the way to the party location.
