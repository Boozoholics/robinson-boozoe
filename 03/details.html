<strong>The Event</strong><br>
As already mentioned, Robinson Boozoe is the best norwegian summer event, scenewise that is. We've decided to make it a demo party, but you shouldn't mistake it for a computer party; it's not. This means that you will <strong>not bring any of your computer gear</strong> (except for disks or cd's with your production). Instead, you will bring money for the entrance fee, food for the bbq, <strong>alcohol</strong> (quite a bit of that) and your best party spirit. In addition to that, you might want to bring some sleeping gear.<br>
</p>
<p>
The price will be 100,- and the money we recieve will be spent on choal for the barbeque and insane amounts of booze for you to consume.
</p>

<p>
<strong>When</strong><br>
The party will take place saturday, <strong>july 12th, 2003</strong>, and of course, it'll go on way into sunday the 13th.
We've desided to accept your arrival from 11:00, and we will kick you out at some point the next day (yes, you are very welcome to help cleaning up).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Where</strong><br>
The party location is at an island in Oslofjorden. More presicely, the name of the island is Bjerkøya. It's situated in Asker, approximately 20 minutes from Oslo by car or one hour by bus, and then a jolly boat ride.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What</strong><br>
So what will we do at this island?<br>
Naturally, we will drink alcohol. The entrance fee will grant you some, but you should basically bring your own booze. If we need to tell you how to drink, you shouldn't be there.
<p>
In addition to that, there will be bbqing. We will have the grill and coal ready, you will have to bring the food, plates to eat it from, and everything else you need to make the meal of your life.
</p>
<p>
Islands are usually surrounded by water, this island is no exception, and you know what that means... yes, you'll be able to swim in the nice, not very polluted Oslofjorden. Towels and swimming gear should be brought, we don't want to see you naked.
</p>
<p>
We will also have a democompo. You deliver your production when you get there, we make sure it's shown at a bigscreen during the party. If you want to make something else than a demo, please note that only intros are accepted (but it will still be a democompo). This means that wild demos, music, pixel, ascii and other submissions won't be accepted. Basically, just forget it. The compo will be a slightly combined compo, accepting entries that works on kusmas laptop (p4-1800, gf4go), in winuae (yes, we're having some hardware trouble) or WinVICE.
</p>
Other than that, you basically do what you would do on a cabin trip.<br>
And then drink some..<br>
And some more..<br>
And some more..<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who</strong><br>
An island (and the cabin) has limited space. This is why we've had to limit the amount of attenders to 35 people. The first to announce their arrival will be accepted until the list is filled up. This means that it's important to us that you tell us if you can't come after all. Don't let other sceners down because of lazyness. If you do. We'll track you down and let Alge loose on you. We know where you live.
