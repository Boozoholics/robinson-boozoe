<strong>general</strong><br/>
As already mentioned, Robinson Boozoe is the biggest norwegian summer event, scenewise that is. We've decided to make it a demo party, but you shouldn't mistake it for a computer party; it's not. This means that you will _not_ bring any of your computer gear (except for disks or cd's with your production). Instead, you will bring money for the entrance fee (TBA), food for the bbq, alcohol (quite a bit of that), and your best party-mood.

<p>
<strong>getting there</strong><br/>
From Oslo: Leave Oslo using E18 towards Drammen. Leave the highway at Holmen, and drive RV165 past Hvervinbukta and Leangbukta towards Vettre. When you get to there turn left by the shop, down Konlungveien. Follow that road until you reach a big parking lot (Spirabukta), this is where you park. This is the right time to call us (menace, kusma or leia) to order boat-pickup. The next thing to do is to walk along the road for a couple of minutes until you reach a brigde, this is were you'll get picked up by boat. When you think you're close (or, if you get lost), you call Kusma, Menace or Leia, who will send a boat to pick you up.

We will of course also put up some signs.

<p>
<strong>So what will we do at this island?</strong><br/>
Naturally, you will drink alcohol. The entrance fee will grant you some, but you should basically also bring your own booze.

In addition to that, there will be bbqing. We will have the grill and coal ready, you will have to bring the food, plates to eat it from, and everything else you need to make the meal of your life.
